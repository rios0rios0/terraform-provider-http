# http Provider

The HTTP provider allows you to interact with Web endpoints using HTTP requests. It is useful for interacting with RESTful APIs, webhooks, and other HTTP-based services.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    http = {
      source = "rios0rios0/http"
    }
  }
}

# Traditional provider configuration with URL (backward compatible)
provider "http" {
  url = "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com"
  basic_auth = {
    username = "something"
    password = "***"
  }
  ignore_tls = true
}

# Alternative: Provider with no URL (resources provide their own URLs)
# This enables using count/for_each with different APIs
provider "http" {
  ignore_tls = true  # Global TLS setting, can be overridden per resource
}

# Example: Using count with different APIs (main use case)
variable "apis" {
  default = [
    {
      name     = "jsonplaceholder"
      base_url = "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com"
      path     = "/posts/1"
      auth     = false
    },
    {
      name     = "httpbin"
      base_url = "https://httpbin.org"
      path     = "/get"
      auth     = true
      username = "testuser"
      password = "testpass"
    }
  ]
}

resource "http_request" "multi_api_calls" {
  count = length(var.apis)
  
  # Resource-level configuration (overrides provider-level)
  base_url = var.apis[count.index].base_url
  
  method = "GET"
  path   = var.apis[count.index].path
  
  # Conditional resource-level authentication
  basic_auth = var.apis[count.index].auth ? {
    username = var.apis[count.index].username
    password = var.apis[count.index].password
  } : null
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `basic_auth` (Attributes) Credentials for basic authentication. This attribute allows you to specify the username and password required for basic HTTP authentication. It is optional and should be used when the target Web endpoint requires basic authentication for access. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--basic_auth))
- `ignore_tls` (Boolean) A boolean flag to indicate whether TLS certificate verification should be ignored. This is useful for testing purposes or when interacting with APIs that use self-signed certificates. It is optional and defaults to `false`.
- `url` (String) The base URL for all HTTP requests made by this provider. This URL serves as the root endpoint for the Web endpoint that the provider will interact with. This is optional when base_url is specified at the resource level.

### Nested Schema for `basic_auth`

Required:

- `password` (String, Sensitive) The password for basic authentication. This is a required field within the `basic_auth` block and must be provided if basic authentication is used. The password is marked as sensitive to ensure it is not exposed in logs or state files.
- `username` (String) The username for basic authentication. This is a required field within the `basic_auth` block and must be provided if basic authentication is used.
